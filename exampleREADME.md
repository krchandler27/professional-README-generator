## Project Description
I was given some very basic starter code and I was able to then add to that code to create an application with node's fs and inquirer packages that will ask the user a series of questions needed to generate a professional README.md file. Those answers are then inserted into the exampleREADME.md file and a professional README.md file is generated for the user. 

## Installation Instructions
Download my professional-README-generator repo, install node, and install inquirer.js (type npm install inquirer@8.2.4 into the command line once in the correct folder), and enjoy!

## Usage Information
This application can be invoked by using the following command: node index. The user will then answer the prompt questions and a professional exampleREADME.md file will be generated.
